# Airbnb-New-User
Dataset from Kaggle: Airbnb New User Bookings.

We predicted in which country a new Airbnb user will make his or her first booking based on their demographic information and user habits. 
First we did data pre-processing and Exploratory Data Analysis. Then we built 3 models (Extreme Gradient Boosting, Recursive Partitioning, Random Forest) to to fit the data and used Random Forest to make prediction.
